# ðŸ‘‹ I'm Pablo Pastorino
### Living in ðŸ‡¦ðŸ‡· Bahia Blanca, Argentina.
I am a proactive, self-confident and communicatively clear person, always looking forward to the future with enthusiasm.
I strive while working both in the logical and creative areas, always seeking to apply the most practical, efficient and original solution. I feel very comfortable playing the developer role both front-end and back-end with deep learning of the technologies I use. Watching for quality, innovation and the creation of useful products focused on providing a solution to the human being who will use them.
